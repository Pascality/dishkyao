          Dear Participants,
          <br>
          We are delighted to welcome you to the 7th edition of the Sri Sri
          University International Model United Nations Conference, scheduled at
          Sri Sri University, Cuttack, Odisha, from February 16th to 18th,
          2024.<br>
  
          To ensure a smooth and enriching experience, we present the following
          comprehensive guidelines: <br>
        </p>
  
        <p class="gp">
          <span class="bold">Registration and Deadlines</span><br>
  
          1. First-Come, First-Serve: Registration operates on a first-come,
          first-serve basis. Once capacity is reached, delegates will be
          waitlisted and moved to the next available committee. <br>
  
          2. Allotments: Country and committee assignments depend on availability
          and delegate experience. <br>

          fees, and Transport fees, are non-refundable. <br>
  
          2. Transferability: While all fees are transferable, transfers in a
          different round than the original registration incur an increase in

          3. Delegation Combining: Combining two single delegations into a double
          delegation is not allowed. <br>

          Delegates are subject to fines or potential debarment from the committee
